# React Audio Player

Audio Player in React which plays local songs from the computer without any need of external music player.
## Now just use your browser for playing songs instead of any other music player and free some workload from the computer. 😁😜

# Setup
- Change folder directory present in fetchData.js inside audio-server so that nodejs knows which folder to serve.
- Navigate to audio-server and run the local server using nodemon or node. Server running on PORT 3001
- Navigate to src folder of the App and run the local react server. Server running on PORT 3000
- Open http://localhost:3000/ and your favourite songs from your local computer. 😎
